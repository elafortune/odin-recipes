 <h2> Description </h2>
  </p> White Castle sliders are well known in the Chicago area. I believe down South they are called Krystals. This copycat recipe is the closest I have come to the real deal. Serve each slider with American cheese, dill pickle slices, and Düsseldorf mustard. </p>
 
 <p> This meal can be made under 25 min and served up to 24 persons </p>


 <ul> <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<li> 1 ½ pounds ground chuck </li>
<li> ⅓ cup plain bread crumbs  </li>
<li> 1 large egg </li>
<li> 1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
<li>2 tablespoons water </li>
<li> ½ teaspoon ground black pepper  </li>
<li>24 small square dinner rolls  </li>

</ul>
 
 
 
 <ol> <h3>Step by step guide: </h3>
<li>  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) </li>
<li> Combine ground chuck, bread crumbs, egg, onion soup mix, water, and black pepper in a bowl; press into a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. Prick holes through the chuck mixture for ventilation while cooking. </li>

<li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain excess grease. </li>

<li>Cut chuck mixture into squares the size of the rolls. Place 1 chuck patty in each roll. </li>
</ol>
